- Have peasants check if there's an obstacle before moving onto a square
- Have peasants send in their new positions when they've reached a new location
- Store peasant locations per-game
- exchange token with 'player' so only they can control the game; others can watch
- test if 2 people accept a task at the same time

- make new sprites for peasant facing each of 4 directions
	- switch peasant sprites based on peasant.direction 0-3 param
- add a peasant 'time to completion' param so they know how long to work on a task
- peasant damage param; display in peasant info


====================================
- consider ability to view all tasks
